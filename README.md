# Massacre dos Calouros
A game made in the Object Oriented Programming I class, a second semester (at the time) class of my Computer Engineering undergraduate course, which was in 2010/2.

It's in Portuguese and it's silly, but I've been convinced to upload it here. It uses Windows specific *old* libraries, so it needs to be compiled with Borland's Turbo C++ 3 compiler and run with DOSBox. You need to use `keyboardlayout=br` for it to use codepage 850 and show all the correct special characters.

If you don't see the source file in Turbo C++, create a new one, save it, copy the contents from one to the other, and open the new file. Don't forget that, to generate an executable in Turbo C++, you need to `Compile` and then `Make`.

The remark about playing around midnight is because I don't know what happens with the timestamp comparison logic when the clock rolls over. I never tested.

Nevermind the color of the non playable characters. It used to be dark yellow when I programmed it, but now it's brown. By no means I meant to be offensive to people of any color. For more information, [read about the EGA palette](http://www.shikadi.net/moddingwiki/EGA_Palette).
